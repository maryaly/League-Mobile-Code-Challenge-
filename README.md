# Android Project with Authentication

This project is an Android application built using Kotlin, following modern development practices. The app includes user authentication and integrates various popular libraries for enhanced functionality, scalability, and maintainability.

---

## Features
- User authentication with secure storage of tokens.
- Modern Android UI with `Material Design` components.
- Navigation and UI management using Jetpack libraries.
- Network operations with Retrofit and Gson.
- Dependency injection using Hilt for better modularization.
- Glide integration for image loading and caching.

## Libraries Used
### Core Libraries
- **Kotlin Standard Library**: `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:1.9.0`
  - Provides essential tools for Kotlin development.
- **AndroidX Libraries**:
  - `lifecycle-runtime-ktx`: Manage lifecycle-aware components.
  - `appcompat`: Backward compatibility for older Android versions.
  - `constraintlayout`: Flexible and performant UI layouts.

### UI Components
- **Material Components**: `com.google.android.material:material:1.4.0`
  - Implements Material Design guidelines.
- **RecyclerView**: `androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.2.1`
  - Optimized view for displaying large data sets.
- **CircleImageView**: `de.hdodenhof:circleimageview:3.1.0`
  - Displays circular profile images.

### Networking
- **Retrofit**: `com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0` and `converter-gson`
  - Simplifies network calls and JSON parsing.
- **Logging Interceptor**: `com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor:4.9.1`
  - Logs HTTP requests and responses for debugging.
- **Gson**: `com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.8`
  - Parses JSON data.

### Dependency Injection
- **Hilt**: `com.google.dagger:hilt-android:2.48` and `hilt-compiler`
  - Simplifies dependency injection setup.

### Image Loading
- **Glide**: `com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.11.0`
  - Efficiently loads and caches images.

### Navigation
- **Jetpack Navigation**: 
  - `androidx.navigation:navigation-fragment-ktx` and `navigation-ui-ktx:2.8.5`
  - Handles navigation and UI transitions seamlessly.

## Project Setup
### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Bumblebee or higher.
- JDK 11 or higher.
- Gradle 8.0+.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync the Gradle files.

---

## Authentication Workflow
The app implements a secure authentication flow:
1. User enters their credentials.
2. Credentials are sent to the server using Retrofit.
3. Upon success, an authentication token is returned.
4. The token is securely stored using **Armadillo**.
5. For subsequent API calls, the token is retrieved and included in headers for authorization.

## Development Guide
### Adding a New Feature
1. Create a new ViewModel for business logic.
2. Add necessary UI changes in the corresponding Fragment.
3. Integrate network calls using Retrofit in the Repository layer.
4. Use Hilt to inject dependencies where needed.

### Code Formatting
The project follows the Kotlin coding style guide. Use the **Kotlin Formatter** plugin in Android Studio for consistency.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Implement biometric authentication.
- Add unit tests for ViewModel and Repository layers.
- Optimize image loading with placeholders using Glide.
